Work in progress, currently prototyping for fit/tolerances, stackup, fasteners, manufacturing, etc.

ToDo:
** Design Mids/Bottom with Tenting Holes (as extra layer)
** Insert Small Bottom Plate in Mid layers
** Insert Top Plate in Mid layers
* hipro, 1u1u/2ustab
* Design Mid Layer/Bottom Plate for Wireless ErgoTravel (No TRRS connector) (as layer?)
- figure out how layers/groups/viewports work for easier viewing, exporting, etc.
- experiment with segmented midlayer(s), saves significant material, easier/stronger to ship
- get local material/cutting quotes
- see how long it takes the Rabbit, what the finish/kerf/accuracy is like...

ToTry:
- colors? something other than clear/white/smoke scraps
- air assist OFF?? for cleaner edges per https://www.troteclaser.com/fileadmin/content/images/News/EN_US/2016-07-crown-trophy/Handbook-for-engravers.pdf
- experiment with "internal pcb" screws through the top plate, for strength (holes are there already, why not) and potentially as a use for the scrap from wasteful midlayer cut (applies for 3mm thickness)

ToDFM:
* try lower power+speed and/or higher Hz for cleaner edge finish
* cutline ordering with colors, to spread/prevent offgassing thumps and make better use of traverse
- figure out optimal sheet/plate/bed size, important for cut layout, production runs, colors, etc. either on the Trotec or external
- shared cutlines!

ToMeh:
- re-import "construction" layer from previous drawing
- re-import "PCB" layer from previous drawing
- wiggle reset button hole over just a wee bit

ToDone:
*** switch to MX+Alps cutouts, they're also openable!!
*** 2U/1U Combined stabilizer hole
* 2U Stab Hole stepped engrave over bar, how will other stabs fit? make sure 1u1u and 2u keycaps cover clear engrave surface finish
- separate keyswitch/1u1u/2ustab layers
- N/A due to stackup --- with noticeable kerf on the 9mm single midlayer, do we want to kick the bottom layer out 0.?mm to eliminate slight edge where they meet?
