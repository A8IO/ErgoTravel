Work in progress, currently prototyping for fit/tolerances, stackup, fasteners, manufacturing, etc.

ToDo:
- hipro, 1u1u/2ustab
- separate keyswitch/1u1u/2ustab layers
- figure out how layers/groups/viewports work for easier viewing, exporting, etc.
- experiment with segmented midlayer(s), saves significant material, easier/stronger to ship
- get local material/cutting quotes

ToTry:
- colors? something other than clear/white/smoke scraps
- try lower power+speed and/or higher Hz for cleaner edge finish
- air assist OFF?? for cleaner edges per https://www.troteclaser.com/fileadmin/content/images/News/EN_US/2016-07-crown-trophy/Handbook-for-engravers.pdf
- experiment with "internal pcb" screws through the top plate, for strength (holes are there already, why not) and potentially as a use for the scrap from wasteful midlayer cut (but thickness?)
- with noticeable kerf on the 9mm single midlayer, do we want to kick the bottom layer out 0.?mm to eliminate slight edge where they meet?

ToMeh:
- re-import "construction" layer from previous drawing
- re-import "PCB" layer from previous drawing
- wiggle reset button hole over just a wee bit

ToDFM:
- figure out optimal sheet/plate/bed size, important for cut layout, production runs, colors, etc. either on the Trotec or external
- cutline ordering with colors, to spread/prevent offgassing thumps and make better use of traverse
- shared cutlines!
